# Document Processing Tool
This Python application, built with Tkinter, is designed to manage, process, and transform image and document files efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface for single-file or bulk processing across various tasks such as renaming, resizing, compressing, and converting files. Key features include:

# Image and Document Handling: Supports multiple file types (PNG, JPG, JPEG, HEIC, TIFF, GIF, WEBP, PDF).
Compression and Resizing: Allows compression within a target size, maintaining quality with dimension adjustments when necessary.
# Format Conversion: Converts files between formats, including automatic RGB conversion for JPEG compatibility.
# Folder Operations: Batch processing of files within folders, with a rename option to systematically organize output files.
# User Interface: A Tkinter-based GUI with interactive progress tracking, file and folder browsing, and real-time updates.

# Setup
Ensure required libraries (Pillow, pillow_heif) are installed. Run app_icon.webp for a custom icon and cropped-wrl-logo-new.png as an optional logo in the GUI. Start the application by running the script, and follow the UI instructions for file or folder processing.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Required Libraries: Pillow, pillow_heif, Tkinter
