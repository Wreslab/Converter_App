# Document Processing Tool
This Python application, built with Tkinter, is designed to manage, process, and transform image and document files efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface for single-file or bulk processing across various tasks such as renaming, resizing, compressing, and converting files. Key features include:

Image and Document Handling: Supports multiple file types (PNG, JPG, JPEG, HEIC, TIFF, GIF, WEBP, PDF).
Compression and Resizing: Allows compression within a target size, maintaining quality with dimension adjustments when necessary.
Format Conversion: Converts files between formats, including automatic RGB conversion for JPEG compatibility.
Folder Operations: Batch processing of files within folders, with a rename option to systematically organize output files.
User Interface: A Tkinter-based GUI with interactive progress tracking, file and folder browsing, and real-time updates.

# Setup
Ensure required libraries (Pillow, pillow_heif) are installed. Run app_icon.webp for a custom icon and cropped-wrl-logo-new.png as an optional logo in the GUI. Start the application by running the script, and follow the UI instructions for file or folder processing.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Required Libraries: Pillow, pillow_heif, Tkinter

# Instructions to Run the Application
* Do Not Delete Any Files: All files in this directory are essential for the application to function. Do not delete, move, or rename any files or folders.
* Starting the Application: Locate the file named test in this directory. Double-click on test to launch the application.
* Alternative Start (If Needed): Right-click the test file and select "Run as administrator" for necessary permissions. You can also run it via Command Prompt by navigating to this folder and typing test.

# Step-by-Step Guide to Using the Document Processing Tool
To create a step-by-step guide with explanations for using this Document Processing Tool, I’ll break down each part of the interface and explain its functionality. I’ll describe each step based on what’s visible in the interface.

# Step 1 : Select Operation Type
Choose between "Single File Operation" and "Folder Operation".
* Single File Operation: Processes one file at a time.
* Folder Operation: Processes all files in a specified folder.

# Step 2: Choose File or Folder
* For Single File Operation: Click Browse File to select the file you want to process.
* For Folder Operation: Click Source Folder to select the folder containing files to process. Click Destination Folder to choose where the processed files will be saved.

# Step 3: Select Action
Choose an action from the "Select Action" dropdown menu:
* Rename: Renames files according to a specified pattern.
* Convert: Converts files between formats (e.g., PNG to JPG). It also performs automatic RGB conversion to maintain compatibility, especially for JPEGs.
* Compress: Compresses files to a target size, with adjustments to dimensions if needed.
* Resize: Resizes images to new dimensions, maintaining quality and aspect ratio when possible.
